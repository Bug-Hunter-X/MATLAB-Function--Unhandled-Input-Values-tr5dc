This repository demonstrates a common error in MATLAB functions: failing to handle unexpected input values.  The `bug.m` file contains a function with limited input validation.  The `bugSolution.m` file provides a corrected version with improved error handling and robustness.  The function intends to double the input if it's between 0 and 10, otherwise return -1 or 11 for out of range inputs. The initial version omits handling inputs outside this range, resulting in incorrect output or errors.
